# Data_Genie
In this project, Power BI fetches the Monthly Sales Data for an organization "Data Genie" directly from Outlook without opening the email and loading and transforming the data, making an aesthetic dashboard, and sending it directly to the stakeholders.

To start the project, open Outlook, the home tab, rules, and create rules.
